Term Project
------------

One goal of this course is to go through a full design cycle of a relational artifact. This includes developing a design concept of a relational artifact, getting feedback from focus groups, implementing technical aspects of it, evaluating those aspects, and possibly revising the design. A working demo at the end of the semester is ideal.

*   If your research already involves building a relational artifact, you are welcome to use this course as a vehicle for furthering its design and realization.
*   The term project can be a full design presentation summarizing the semester's activities and final outcome and evaluation.
*   OR, you can propose a different project with approval from the instructor. For instance, you may want to write a conference-style paper on relational artifacts, or you may want to focus on implementing specific technical capability.
